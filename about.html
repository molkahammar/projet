    Hello, my name is Julie, my creations are made from my workshop Kaz A Lily located in Guillestre in the Southern Alps.
    It is a concept store where you will find my creations, zen fashion but it is also a space dedicated to well-being (yoga and sonotherapy)
    Lily shop is the online store of Kaz A Lili,My creations are composed of fine models and other small treasures of famous actors dressed,
    fabric that I like because of their softness and singularity What I like is to let go of my creativity with what I have in stock,
    that's why some models are unique or in very small quantities Each collection has a star name and each model is numbered to facilitate our communication,
    if numbers are missing it is that they have been sold Why did you choose the stars? Because each of my creations is filled with love and every gesture of love is imprinted 
    in the heart of the universe.
    Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions I will answer them with pleasure, I wish you a pleasant visit
